# FreeMyXe Compatibility Database

This is a community-driven compatibility database for Games and Homebrew running on [**FreeMyXe**](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/FreeMyXe)**-patched Xbox 360 consoles**.
The goal is to document which Games and Homebrew work, which have issues, and any possible fixes.

### How to Use:
1. **Check Compatibility**:  
   Browse the [Retail Games](/Retail.md), or [Homebrew](/Homebrew.md) lists to see if a title works with FreeMyXe.

2. [**Contribute**](#how-to-contribute):  
   If you've tested a Game or Homebrew, contribute your findings by creating a pull request or using the Issues tab to report compatibility. See [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute) for more.

3. **Additional Information**:  
   Visit the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/XDanfr/FMX-Compatibility/wiki) for more detailed guides on testing and patching methods.
  
> [!NOTE]
> This repo is made for **legally dumped Games** and Homebrew. This does **not** serve for piracy.
> While pirated Games *will usually* run the same, this repo is made for people to see which legally dumped Games and Homebrew will run and therefore does not support or endorse piracy in any way.

## Game Compatibility List
Compatibility reports are categorised as follows:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Works | Fully functional with no issues. |
| ⚠️ Partially | Works, but has glitches or requires fixes. |
| ❌ Borked | Does not work or crashes. |
| 👤 Offline | Only use an offline account (not Xbox Live) to prevent a ban. |

## Assumptions
- All s and Homebrew listed in this database are assumed to have been patched using one of the methods in the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/XDanfr/FMX-Compatibility/wiki) before testing. If a title does not work, please ensure it has been properly patched before reporting compatibility issues.
- **Arcade games should work out of the box** in GoD format, but if you experience any issues, please report them via the issues tab or add them to the database.

> [!NOTE]
> If a Game or Homebrew doesn't work via XexTool, it's very likely that it'll work via [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUajcJjVaPY) (video). This is the recommended method.

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting
- **Game not working after patching?**  
  Make sure you followed the recommended patching method outlined in the [Wiki](https://github.com/XDanfr/FMX-Compatibility/wiki/Recommended-method:-How-to-patch-Title-Updates).  
- **Problems with Indie Games?**  
  Indie Games often require an Xbox Live connection, which could lead to a potential **ban** from Microsoft if you are using FreeMyXe. While these games will generally work when connected, we strongly **recommend using an offline account** to prevent any risk.

## How to Contribute
We rely on the community to expand and maintain this database (though I will be posting a lot here too with my findings!). To submit a compatibility report:

1. **Fork this repo**
2. **Edit the relevant markdown file**
3. **Use this format** when adding a new Game or Homebrew:
   ```md
   | Game/Homebrew Title        | Works? | Notes (Crashes, Fixes, Patches)      |
   |----------------------------|:------:|--------------------------------------|
   | Example Game               |   ⚠️   | Crashes after loading world 2        |
   | Another Game               |  ✅ 👤 | No issues found, use offline account |
   | Yet Another                |   ❌   | Doesn't launch at all                |
   ```
   So that it'll look like this:

   | Game/Homebrew Title        | Works? | Notes (Crashes, Fixes, Patches)      |
   |----------------------------|:------:|--------------------------------------|
   | Example Game               |   ⚠️   | Crashes after loading world 2        |
   | Another Game               |  ✅ 👤 | No issues found, use offline account |
   | Yet Another                |   ❌   | Doesn't launch at all                |


4. **Submit a pull request** with your changes.

Alternatively, you can report compatibility using **GitHub Issues**:
- Open an [**Issue**](https://github.com/XDanfr/FMX-Compatibility/issues/new?template=compatibility_report.yml) and follow the provided template.

We are also looking for contributors! Check the top of this readme to find out more.

> [!NOTE]
> To avoid compatibility issues, **always make sure you're using the latest version** of [BadUpdate](https://github.com/grimdoomer/Xbox360BadUpdate/releases/latest) and [FreeMyXe](https://github.com/InvoxiPlayGames/FreeMyXe/releases/latest).

## Help Wanted

- **Testing** additional [Homebrew](/Homebrew.md) and documenting their compatibility.
- **Improving** the [Wiki](https://github.com/XDanfr/FMX-Compatibility/wiki) with easier to understand patching instructions.
- **Translating** the repo into other languages to make it more accessible globally.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Revise the issue reporting experience to be more helpful for owners and contributors.
