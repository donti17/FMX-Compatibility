> [!NOTE]
> - **Remember to patch your Games!** Be sure to follow one of the tutorials in the [Wiki](https://github.com/XDanfr/FMX-Compatibility/wiki) to ensure proper functionality.
> - Before adding a `❌ Borked` Game to this list, **try removing any title updates**. Some games may only work when title updates are deleted.
> - If a Game is listed as `❌ Borked` or `⚠️ Partial` in a specific format, try converting via another method. It might work completely!!
